### **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** 
  - where an agent learns a policy using a neural network that is trained to maximize cumulative rewards through interaction with the environment.
  - Test environment: **Pendulum**
  - ‚≠ê Training process:

### **Weight Agnostic Neural Networks (WAN)** 
  - a method that uses fixed network architectures and weights, relying on the structure of the network and activation functions rather than extensive training.
  - Test environment: **Pendulum**
  - ‚≠ê Training process:
